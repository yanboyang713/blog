## Summary
I have a broad range of research interests, spanning distributed networked systems, cloud computing, anomaly detection, and machine learning algorithms. My recent work focuses on building and optimizing cellular networks using practical machine learning (ML) techniques, with time-series analysis, hyperparameter tuning, and simulation methodologies.

I hold a Master’s degree in Statistics and Operations Research from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Wollongong. Prior to coming to the U.S., I accumulated four years of industry experience as a Cloud Solutions Engineer and Algorithm Engineer at Microsoft and Peng Cheng Laboratory. My work there centered on data center networks and ML systems (Azure Machine Learning Service).

I am deeply passionate about exploring new technologies and methodologies, always eager to tackle challenges and venture into uncharted territories.
